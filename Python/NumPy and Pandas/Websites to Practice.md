You can practice NumPy and pandas on several interactive and problem-based sites that fit well with your data science goals.

## Pure practice problem sets

- **w3resource – NumPy & Pandas**: Huge collections with thousands of graded problems from basic to advanced, all with solutions and explanations for both NumPy and pandas.[1][2]
- **w3resource – Pandas + NumPy for data analysis**: Mixed exercises that combine both libraries in realistic data-analysis style tasks.[3]
- **GeeksforGeeks – NumPy & Pandas practice**: Many coding questions focused on arrays, indexing, searching, DataFrames, cleaning, and time series.[4][5]

## Structured exercise sets (with solutions)

- **NumPy 100 (GitHub)**: Classic set of 100 NumPy problems (with solutions) often used in interviews and courses.[6]
- **Pandas Exercises (GitHub – guipsamora/pandas_exercises)**: Exercise notebooks with instructions and separate solution files to practice real-world data wrangling.[7]
- **Pynative – 50 NumPy exercises**: Guided questions from beginner to advanced with hints and detailed solutions.[8]

## Interactive tutorial + quiz style

- **W3Schools NumPy & Pandas exercises**: Short, topic-wise exercises (MCQ + fill-in-the-blank) directly connected to tutorials; you can track progress if you log in.[9][10][11]
- **W3Schools online NumPy compiler**: In-browser editor where you can run NumPy code without local setup, useful if you are on a college system or tablet.[12]

## Combined NumPy + Pandas practice for data analysis

- **w3resource “Pandas and NumPy exercises for data analysis”**: Focused on tasks like reshaping, joining, groupby, and numerical operations on arrays and DataFrames.[3]
- **GeeksforGeeks “Pandas and NumPy exercise for data analysis”**: Topic-wise coding problems for both libraries oriented toward real data-analysis workflows.[4]

## How to use these effectively

- Start with topic-wise basics on W3Schools or Pynative (arrays, indexing, DataFrame basics).[11][9][8]
- Move to NumPy-100 and GitHub pandas_exercises for slightly harder, interview-style problems.[7][6]
- Regularly pick a dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) and try to apply what you practiced in w3resource’s Pandas/NumPy data-analysis sets.[13][3]

If you share whether you prefer browser-only practice or working in Jupyter on your laptop, a concrete 2–3 week NumPy+pandas practice plan can be suggested next.
