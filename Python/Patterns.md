# Basic
There are a handful of core **patterns** that appear again and again in coding interviews, and learning them (with 5–10 problems each) is one of the fastest ways to improve.[1][2]

## Must-know patterns

- Two pointers (for arrays/strings where the data is sorted or you move from both ends).[3][1]
- Sliding window (for subarray/substring questions like “longest”, “smallest”, “at most K”).[1][3]
- Fast & slow pointers (cycle detection, middle of linked list, etc.).[1]
- Binary search / modified binary search (on sorted arrays, answer space, or monotonic functions).[3][1]
- DFS and BFS on trees/graphs (traversal, counting islands, shortest paths in unweighted graphs).[4][1]
- Recursion + backtracking (subsets, permutations, combinations, N-Queens, word search).[2][1]
- Merge intervals (merging/adding intervals, meeting rooms, calendar/time range problems).[2][1]
- Subsets / combinatorics (generate all subsets, combinations, partitions).[1]
- Top K elements with heaps (kth largest, k closest points, top K frequent).[5][1]
- Basic dynamic programming patterns like 0/1 knapsack, subset sum, and simple DP on sequences.[6][1]

## Slightly more advanced but common

- Cyclic sort (arrays with numbers in 1..n, find missing/duplicate).[3][1]
- In-place reversal of linked list (reverse list, reverse in k-groups).[1]
- Bit manipulation / XOR tricks (find single non-duplicate, swap without temp, subsets via bits).[4][1]
- Topological sort (course schedule, dependency ordering in DAGs).[4][1]
- Monotonic stack (next greater element, largest rectangle in histogram).[7][1]

## How to practice these patterns

- Pick one pattern (say sliding window), read 2–3 short explanations, then solve 8–10 LeetCode or similar problems only from that pattern.[6][1]
- After solving, write a 3–5 line “template” for that pattern in your preferred language, so you can quickly recall the structure in interviews.[6][3]
- Rotate through 4–5 high‑ROI patterns first: two pointers, sliding window, DFS/BFS, binary search, backtracking.[2][4]

If you share your current level (beginner / intermediate / advanced) and preferred language, a focused 4–6 week pattern‑based plan can be outlined next.

------------------
When to stop collecting patterns
If you can recognize and implement the patterns listed in Grokking’s 20 patterns and ByteByteGo’s chapters (two pointers, hash maps, linked lists, sliding window, 
binary search, stacks, heaps, intervals, prefix sums, trees, tries, graphs, backtracking, DP, greedy, sort & search, bit manipulation, math/geometry), you already 
have more than enough for typical product-company interviews.
​

After that point, your improvement comes mainly from practice and speed, not from discovering brand‑new patterns.
